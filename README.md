# Awesone Neural Rendering (WiP)

A curated list of awesome neural rendering resources!

Neural rendering is emerging technology that envisons a way to render (mostly) 3D objects into 2D images with deep neural networks, instead of conventional rasterization and ray tracing.

Please enjoy the list and [contribution](#contributing) is welcome!
